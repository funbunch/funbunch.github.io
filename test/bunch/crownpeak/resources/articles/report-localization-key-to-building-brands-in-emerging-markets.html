        <h2>Report: Localization key to building brands in emerging markets</h2>
        <div class="about-info">Rapid growth in the world’s emerging markets presents an enormous opportunity for organizations to expand their operations and influence. A recent <a href="" target="blank">McKinsey Quarterly report</a> projected that consumption in these markets - which include China, India, Brazil and many other countries in Latin America, Asia and Africa - will reach $30 trillion by 2025, offering a major incentive for organizations looking to expand.</div>
        <img src="../../assets/images/about-img.jpg" alt="" class="about-img">

        <p>Fueled by this expansion, consumer behavior in these markets is also shifting as many individuals encounter new products and brands for the first time. A separate McKinsey Quarterly report evaluated the unique conditions this environment creates for brands as they expand into these markets and offered specific recommendations for delivering tailored messages to attract new consumers.</p>

        <p>“As in developed markets, technology is unleashing the possibility of increasingly deep customer engagement at each phase of the journey, but with some important twists reflecting differences in the characteristics of emerging-market consumers, who generally don’t have the same level of experience with brands and product categories as their developed-market counterparts do,” McKinsey researchers noted.</p>

        <p>In particular, the report highlighted three major differences between emerging markets and developed ones that organizations will want to take into account as they expand and look to solutions for localization. Word-of-mouth, initial brand consideration and in-store experiences are all crucial in emerging markets, researchers determined.</p>

        <h4>Geographic differences in the value of word of mouth</h4>

        <p>According to McKinsey surveys, word of mouth is a much stronger driver of market decisions in emerging markets as opposed to places such as the United States and United Kingdom.</p>

        <p>While around 40 percent of U.S. consumers and 30 percent of those in the U.K. said they received recommendations from friends and family when buying food and beverage products, the figure was more than 70 percent in China and more than 90 percent in Egypt. This discrepancy is largely due to the fact that many individuals in emerging economies are buying certain products for the first time and therefore look to the opinions of nearby friends and family.</p>

        <p>Online recommendations are also not as widespread. Only 23 percent of Chinese consumers acquired information online about products they bought, according to the report, as opposed to around 60 percent of those in the United States and the United Kingdom. Since word of mouth is largely a local phenomenon, researchers noted that the best way to build a brand in an emerging market is often to target specific locations.</p>
  
        <p>“Companies in emerging markets are likely to reap higher returns if they pursue a strategy of geographic focus than if they spread marketing resources around thinly (targeting all big cities nationwide, for example),” researchers wrote, citing examples of a Chinese bottled water company that dominates the market in the country’s south and the efforts of a U.S.-based personal care products company to introduce its brand of sanitary napkins in localized communities in India.</p>

        <h4>Achieving brand visibility</h4>
        
        <p>The report determined that emerging market consumers generally consider fewer brands initially and switch brands less often than consumers in developed economies. As a result, brand visibility is important, as is establishing credibility as a market leader.</p>

        <p>Since media is often very geographically specific in emerging markets, targeting localized communities is an important part of building visibility for a brand. To gain an edge, organizations should consider adopting localized and even hyper-localized content, and they should be prepared to tailor their messages for small markets.</p>

        <p>“Companies also need to reach these consumers with messages that have been tailored to suit local market preferences and concerns, and are likely to be trusted,” McKinsey researchers wrote. “Testing messages - even those that have delivered powerful results in developed markets - is a key part of that equation.”</p>

        <p>The report offered the example of a computer manufacturer that initially attempted to stress the low cost of its PCs in China as it had done in other markets. However, the message that the computers were a good value for the money was interpreted by Chinese consumers, who were more concerned with durability, as a suggestion the computers might not be reliable. By shifting the message to highlight reliability, the company built a more trusted brand and doubled its market share.</p>

        <h4>In-store decision-making</h4>
        <p>One additional finding of the McKinsey study was that consumers in emerging markets placed enormous significance on the in-store purchasing experience, often making multiple trips and carefully evaluating products. Yet emerging markets also tend to offer less standardization in the retail landscape, often requiring more direct engagement with local sellers to build their presence. A major soft drink brand, for instance, sells most of its volume in Indonesia directly to local retailers or small distributors with fewer than five employees.</p>
        <p>In other words, a localized approach is essential across all aspects of a brand’s expansion into emerging market, and engaging with these consumers can require a different approach than organizations are used to pursuing.</p>

        <p>“It requires bold investment decisions, efforts to build the skills of local teams, and the courage to operate in ways that are fundamentally different from what headquarters might regard as normal,” the McKinsey researchers wrote.</p>
